# Apache-Spark-Recommender-System


The project is to provide Collaborative, Content-based, Demographic and Knowledge-based Recommendations in Fibre2Fashion. We are going to use Apache Spark as a large scale Data processing engine and Java as well as Scala for Programming.

The aim of the research project was to build recommednations system. User engagement is currently the biggest challenge in each and every product based industry having their web portals with a large number of users.

Our solution of the project is to build ETL pipeline for processing real time Logs generated by system. The processed Data will be fed to Spark engine that will further processed the data and fed that data to algorithm. Alternating least square algorithm was implemented for Collaborative Filtering.

The result of the project was the system which will exploit users data and items database along with thier ratings, and target user history to recommend a item that target user doesn't have ratings. 


This project is partially updated because of policy.
